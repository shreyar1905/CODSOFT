🎬 Movie Rating/Revenue Prediction
This project focuses on predicting either the IMDb rating or box office revenue of movies using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various features such as cast, genre, budget, and runtime, we build a regression model to forecast a movie's success.

📌 Objective
Build a machine learning model to predict a movie’s rating or revenue based on its metadata and attributes.
