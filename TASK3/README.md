🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction
This project aims to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning. The model is trained on passenger data such as age, gender, ticket class, and fare.

📌 Objective
Build a classification model that predicts if a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on available features.
