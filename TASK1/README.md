🌸 Iris Flower Classification
The Iris Flower Classification project is a beginner-level machine learning task where the goal is to classify iris flowers among three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on four features:

Sepal length

Sepal width

Petal length

Petal width

📌 Objective
Build a classification model using machine learning algorithms to accurately predict the species of iris flowers based on the given features.

📊 Dataset
The dataset used is the famous Iris dataset, originally introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936.
It contains 150 samples divided equally among the three species.
